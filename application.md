        Greetings to all you awesome people at Formidable! Although I haven't used GitHub before, I really wanted to showcase my eagerness to learn. Now that I've got your attention, let's talk web design!
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been coding in HTML/CSS for 5 years and retain a basic knowledge of JavaScript. A majority of my work has been in Wordpress and private servers managed via FTP. However, I'm all about efficiency, and if Formidable incorporates GitHub I'll learn it! In fact, I'm willing to learn just about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also bring a wealth of project management and design experience, which I'd be happy to discuss with you further during an interview. Looking forward to seeing you soon!
      </p>
